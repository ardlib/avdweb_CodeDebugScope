# `avdweb_SWscope` - Arduino Fast Debug Oscilloscope
## When should you use the Fast Oscilloscope library?
When conventional debugging via the serial monitor isn't feasible.

When the data is too fast for the serial monitor.

When oscilloscope functionality is required.

## Eliminating the disruption of the program by the serial monitor
It is not always possible to debug Arduino programs by the serial monitor, as this disrupts the progress of the program. That's why I developed the Fast Oscilloscope, it has helped me with a lot with complex projects.
